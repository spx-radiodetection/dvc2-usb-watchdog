This module implements a watchdog which triggers if USB_HUB_DET goes low.
USB_RESET_N is then asserted momentarily.  After this, there is a
settling period during which the hub detect interrupt will be ignored.

Example device tree:-

dvc2-usb-watchdog {
        compatible = "dvc2-usb-watchdog";
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
        interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
        reset-gpios = <&gpio3 22 0>;
};
